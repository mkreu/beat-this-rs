#![cfg(feature = "decode")]

//! Golden parity test against the Python reference (`beat_this`).
//!
//! Runs the full Rust pipeline (audio -> mel -> inference -> postprocessing) on
//! the shared mp3 and asserts F-measure == 1.0 at the standard +/-70 ms MIR
//! window for beats and downbeats, versus a golden generated from the Python
//! reference on the matching model (see `scripts/gen_golden.py`).
//!
//! The bit-exact path is impossible here (the mp3 is 44.1 kHz stereo, so Rust's
//! rubato resampler diverges from Python's soxr, and the MP3 decoders differ),
//! so F@70 ms is the divergence-robust metric. Per-matched-beat timing is logged
//! as a diagnostic, not asserted.
